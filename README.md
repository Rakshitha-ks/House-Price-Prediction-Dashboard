## 🧠 Model Details

The regression model was built using:
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling)
- Multiple Linear Regression (using scikit-learn)
- Evaluation metrics: R² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), RMSE

The trained model output and plots were exported and visualized through this Streamlit dashboard.
